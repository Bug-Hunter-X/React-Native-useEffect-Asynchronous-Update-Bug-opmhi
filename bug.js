This React Native code snippet demonstrates a common issue where a state update within a `useEffect` hook does not trigger a re-render.  The problem arises because the asynchronous function call using `setTimeout` doesn't immediately update the `count` state.  Therefore, the component doesn't re-render after the state changes, and the `console.log` will not display the incremented count as expected.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount(count + 1);
      console.log('Count updated:', count); // This will log the old value of count
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
